        <p id="intro-text">Right now, I'm more interested in learning to be a good junior developer. I only learned how to code after college, which was pretty recent, 6 months ago, but I do think I have a certain aptitude to be a good developer, I just want to learn as much as possible. More importantly, I want to have a good attitude about things when learning gets tough and just be an affable, friendly person.</p>
    </span>
        <p>I am attending this class to learn more about web development, learn more Javascript, and branch out to learning Javscript frameworks. More importantly, I want to learn a challenging and interesting skill, that can be both rewarding career-wise and on a personal-development aspect.</p>
